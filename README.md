# Algorithms & Data Structures

This repo contains solutions to canonical algorithms problems in computer
science. It serves as practice for myself to reinforce concepts learned in the
classroom and also provides a way to easily retrieve leetcode solutions through
[leetcode-cli](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=leetcode-tools/leetcode-cli&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8).
